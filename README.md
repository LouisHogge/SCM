# Supply Chain Management Project: Marinero Case

## Project Description
Dear applicant,
Marinero is an Italian firm leading in the field of
high-quality beach equipment. Our main business is production and sale of deckchairs, beach umbrellas, sun beds, directorâ€™s chairs, and frisbees for two main independent markets: private customers (e.g., beach and camping lovers) and business clients (e.g., resorts, hotels, and camps). We produce our products in several manufacturing plants and supply them to sales outlets strategically located all over Italy.
Our products are appreciated, and our brand is indisputably considered high quality. Nevertheless producing and distributing our products has become more and more complex, and the use of a ground-rule approach only based on the expertise of our managers seems to no longer be sufficient to tackle the complexity of the overall system.
We opened a call for selecting a decision support model to identify a competitive strategy for the management of operations.
The proposals should present a feasible solution for our production and distribution planning over the next six months. Proposals must be submitted within the deadline using the format specified in the technical details sheet of the call. The evaluation of the proposals is done by our experts with the solution as- sessment tool (SAT), which allows them to check the actual effectiveness of the proposed choices.
I am sure that you can help Marinero to improve its production and distribution system.
